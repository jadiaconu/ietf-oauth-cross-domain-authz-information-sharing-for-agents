           Cross-Domain AuthZ Information sharing for Agents
                     draft-vc-client-id-metadata-00

Abstract

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems consist of Agents and MCP Servers
   operating across multiple administrative domains, each with its own
   Identity Providers (IdPs) and Authorization Servers (AS).

   In many deployments, a Subject delegates access to one or more Agents
   that operate across domains and invoke MCP Servers to perform tasks
   on the Subject’s behalf.  Each domain relies on its own identity and
   authorization infrastructure, which makes it difficult to share
   authorization information and related identity context along the
   delegation chain in an interoperable and privacy-preserving way.

   This document describes the problem of cross-domain authorization
   information sharing for agents, outlines requirements that arise from
   delegated, multi-domain use cases, and compares how existing
   mechanisms may address those requirements, including dynamic
   identity, interoperable claims, and verifiable credentials.

1.  Introduction

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems contain Agents and MCP Servers
   distributed across multiple administrative domains.

   These domains often use different Identity Providers (IdPs) and
   Authorization Servers (AS), presenting significant challenges for
   secure, interoperable sharing of authorization information.

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents            January 2025


   This document focuses on cross-domain authorization information
   sharing where a Subject delegates access across multiple domains via
   chained agents.

   In the core scenario, a principal (Subject) delegates to an Agent in
   Domain A, which may in turn invoke an Agent in Domain B to access
   resources exposed by an MCP Server in Domain C or another domain.
   Each domain is governed by its own IdPs and ASs, and existing
   mechanisms provide only partial support for propagating authorization
   information and associated identity context along this multi-hop
   path.

   While the motivating examples described here involve Agents and MCP
   Servers, many of the identity and authorization challenges are also
   applicable to other types of clients and resource servers operating
   across domains.

2.  Abbreviations / Definitions

   Agent  An autonomous entity that performs tasks on behalf of a user
      or another program within a multi-agent system.

   MCP Server  A program that exposes specific capabilities, like data
      access or tools, to AI models through the Model Context Protocol
      (MCP).

   AS (Authorization Server)  A server that issues authorization tokens
      to clients after successfully authenticating them.

   IdP (Identity Provider)  A service that creates, manages, and
      verifies digital identities for users and service users, often for
      accessing multiple applications and services.

   Subject  The principal (user or service).

   Claim  Essentially a piece of information asserted about a subject.

   Domain  Scope over which a specific, uniform set of security policies
      and user management rules are enforced.

3.  Problem Statement

   The problem addressed in this document is the sharing of
   authorization information and related identity context across
   multiple administrative domains involved in a delegated, multi-agent
   flow.

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents            January 2025


   In the delegation chain, each Agent and MCP Server typically operates
   with its local notion of the Subject and its own authorization
   configuration.  Existing mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client
   Registration, SCIM-based provisioning, and Client-ID Metadata each
   address aspects of client identity and authorization, but are not
   designed to provide an interoperable, end-to-end way to convey
   authorization information and proofs across domains and hops.

   As a result, implementers face challenges including:

   *  Aligning Subject and agent identity semantics across IdPs and ASs
      operated by different organizations.

   *  Propagating fine-grained authorization information and constraints
      along Agent-to-Agent and Agent-to-MCP interactions without leaking
      unnecessary data.

   *  Avoiding redundant or bespoke per-vendor solutions while still
      meeting security, privacy, and compliance requirements.

             Figure 1: Cross-Domain Multi-Agent Architecture

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems contain Agents and MCP Servers that
   are distributed across multiple administrative domains.  These
   systems involve different Identity Providers (IdPs) / Authorization
   Servers (AS) posing challenges in authorization information sharing
   across these entities.

4.  Use Cases

   This section illustrates example flows in which a Subject delegates
   to one or more Agents operating across domains to access resources
   protected by MCP Servers.  The examples are intended to clarify the
   cross-domain identity and authorization challenges described in the
   Problem Statement.

4.1.  Delegated Access Across Domains

   *Description:* Subject-initiated access where authorization must be
   conveyed along a delegation chain that spans multiple administrative
   domains.

   *Use Case:* A Subject in Domain A uses an Agent (Agent A) to perform
   a task that requires data located in Domain B and processed by an MCP
   Server in Domain C.  Agent A obtains authorization from the AS in
   Domain A and then invokes an Agent in Domain B (Agent B), which in
   turn calls an MCP Server in Domain C.  Each domain relies on its own
   IdP/AS and local policy.  Authorization information and relevant
   identity context for the Subject and Agents need to be shared in a
   way that allows the downstream domains to make policy decisions
   without learning more than is necessary about the Subject or the
   internal policies of upstream domains.

4.2.  Cross-Domain Policy-Constrained Access

   *Description:* Delegated access where each domain imposes its own
   constraints on what an Agent may do on behalf of a Subject.

   *Use Case:* A financial institution in Domain A delegates monitoring
   tasks to an Agent that must access transaction logs exposed by an MCP
   Server operated by a service provider in Domain B.  The Institution’s
   policies restrict the Agent from accessing personally identifiable
   information (PII) and require evidence that the downstream service
   complies with certain regulatory and security controls.  The service
   provider’s policies in Domain B, enforced via its own IdP and AS,
   must evaluate authorization information received from Domain A and
   decide which actions Agent B and the MCP Server are allowed to
   perform, based on both local and cross-domain policy.

5.  Requirements

   A system for cross-domain sharing of authorization information of
   agents needs to meet the following set of requirements.  These
   requirements are derived from the delegated, cross-domain flows
   introduced in the Problem Statement and Use Cases and are intended to
   frame security and interoperability considerations early in this
   document.

   *  *Dynamic Identity for Agents and MCP Servers:* The Agents and MCP
      Servers can onboard dynamically and get an assigned identity in
      the IdP so that delegated access can be attributed and evaluated
      consistently across domains.

   *  *Interoperability Across Domains:* The system must enable
      interaction between Agents and MCP Servers across different
      domains without requiring bespoke, per-domain identity or
      authorization arrangements.

   *  *Flexible Definition of Claims:* Claims should be adaptable as
      they may vary from organization to organization, while still
      allowing relying parties in other domains to interpret and
      evaluate them.

   *  *Dynamic Management of Authorization Information:* The system must
      allow creation, removal, updating, and deletion of authorization
      information for agents, as agents can be highly dynamic and may
      participate in short-lived delegation chains.

   *  *Security and Privacy:* Ensuring secure and privacy-preserving
      sharing of authorization information across domains, including the
      ability to avoid disclosing more information about the Subject or
      Agents than is necessary for a given interaction.

   *  *Compliance and Auditability:* Support for compliance with
      regulatory standards and auditability of authorization exchanges,
      including the ability to trace which Agents and domains
      participated in delegated access.

5.1.  Solution Approach 1: Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)

   *Description:* Dynamic Client Registration as outlined in [RFC7591]
   allows clients to register with an AS dynamically, facilitating the
   management of client credentials and metadata.

   *Discussion:*

   provisioning, management, and governance of AI agents and other
   digital workers.

   [I-D.wahl-scim-agent-schema] is a companion document to the draft-
   abbey-scim-agent-extension.  Its purpose is to define the specific
   SCIM schema and attributes required to represent AI agents (digital
   workers) and agentic applications within the SCIM framework.

   *Description:* Provision Agents / MCP Servers through a SCIM
   extension.

   registration, an authorization server can fetch this JSON document at
   the client's provided URL to provision the identity.

   **Flexible Definition of Claims:* The OAuth claims in the draft
   follow the claims exposed and defined by IANA OAuth Parameters.
   Hence, the metadata fields are limited to a fixed set of claims.
   This makes it difficult to convey richer features about the client,
   including provenance details, compliance attestations, or contextual
   trust scores without introducing vendor-specific extensions, thereby
   reducing portability and interoperability.

   ***Security and Privacy, Compliance and Auditability:* All metadata
   is published to a publicly accessible endpoint.  There is no native
   ability to keep certain attributes private, apply selective
   disclosure, or restrict visibility based on trust relationships.
   Sensitive operational data or compliance-related data must be handled
   outside the metadata framework, leading to fragmented trust models.
   There is no mechanism for revocation and expiration.

        |                            | 4. Validate Metadata |
        |                            |    & Verify VC Signature (JWKS)

          Figure 2: Client-ID Metadata with VC Verification Flow

   *Description:* The proposed solution is based on Solution 3, but
   enhances the supported claims with a new claim, "vc+jwt", based on
   the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 from W3C.

   vc+jwt  A standard method used in decentralized identity to package
      and secure a digital credential.  The Verifiable Credential
      (VC)—the actual data proving a fact (e.g., identity or degree)—is
      encapsulated within a JSON Web Token (JWT), which provides a
      cryptographic signature from the issuer.  This signature allows
      any third party (the Verifier) to instantly confirm the
      credential's authenticity and integrity.  Modern formats like SD-
      JWT VC further enhance this by enabling the holder to share only
      specific parts of the credential (Selective Disclosure) to protect
      privacy.

   *Detailed explanations:*

   The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 addresses the
   shortcomings of the previous Solution 3, by introducing a
   cryptographically verifiable and standards-based way to assert
   identities, capabilities, and compliance attestations.  It supports
   selective disclosure to protect sensitive information, enables time-
   bound and revocable authorizations, and ensures provenance tracking
   for audit and regulatory compliance.  They are part of a broader
   decentralized identity (DID) specification.

   Using the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 for Agents, MCP
   Clients, and MCP Servers provides a standardized, cryptographically
   secure way to establish trust, delegate authority, and ensure
   interoperability across different systems.

   It enables Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers to prove, among other
   things, their identities, identity issuers and provenance, supported
   skills and permitted actions through verifiable proofs, including
   support for fine-grained and time-bound access control, while
   maintaining transparency enabling audit trails for compliance.

   Additionally, it enhances privacy through selective disclosure and
   privacy-preserving proofs (e.g., allowing Agents to prove skills and
   authorized actions without exposing unnecessary details).

   The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 is a W3C standard that fits
   the needs expressed above:

   *(1) Enhanced Interoperability:* VCDM 2.0 provides a standardized,
   extensible way to express identities, capabilities, and compliance
   data across different systems.  Its use of DIDs and schema-governed
   claims ensures that Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers can verify
   and exchange trust information, enabling consistent interoperability
   across domains and platforms.

   *(2) Flexible Definition of Claims:* VCDM 2.0 allows arbitrary,
   schema-governed claims that can represent complex concepts such as
   provenance, software supply-chain attestations (e.g., SLSA), security
   posture, audit certifications (SOC2, ISO-27001), or dynamic trust
   signals.  These claims can be extended without breaking
   interoperability, thanks to widely adopted JSON-LD and schema
   registries.

   *(3) Security and Privacy:* Credentials are signed using verifiable
   cryptographic proofs (e.g., JSON Web Signatures, Data Integrity
   proofs).  This ensures that Agents, MCP clients, and MCP servers can
   verify the authenticity of claims without relying solely on HTTPS
   endpoints or centralized registries.  Through techniques like BBS+
   signatures, holders can disclose only the subset of claims required
   for a given authorization flow.  This is essential for scenarios
   where Agents must prove capabilities (e.g., "I'm allowed to execute
   this skill") without revealing unnecessary or sensitive identity
   attributes.

   *(4) Compliance and Auditability:* VCDM 2.0 enables cryptographically
   verifiable audit trails by binding each credential to an issuer,
   timestamp, and revocation status.  Compliance attestations can be
   embedded directly in credentials, and real-time revocation checks
   ensure they remain valid.  This provides trustworthy provenance,
   regulatory-grade accountability, and reliable lifecycle tracking
   across distributed systems.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.

8.  Security Considerations

   This document does not define a new protocol.  Instead, it analyzes
   how existing mechanisms may be used or profiled to support delegated,
   cross-domain authorization information sharing for Agents and MCP
   Servers.

   Security and privacy considerations arise primarily from:

   *  the need to align Subject and Agent identity semantics across
      domains and IdPs/ASs,

   *  the requirement to share authorization information and proofs
      without disclosing more data than is necessary for a given
      interaction, and

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents            January 2025


   *  the need to support auditability and policy enforcement across
      multi-hop delegation chains.

   These considerations are reflected in the requirements in this
   document and in the discussion of the individual solution approaches.
   Implementations MUST also take into account the security
   considerations of the underlying specifications on which they rely,
   including but not limited to OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration,
   SCIM, Client-ID Metadata, and the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data
   Model.
