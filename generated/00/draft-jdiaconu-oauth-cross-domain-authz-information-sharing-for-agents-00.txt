1.  Introduction

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems, consisting of Agents and Model
   Context Protocol (MCP) Servers, are increasingly deployed across
   multiple administrative domains.  Each domain typically operates its
   own Identity Providers (IdPs) and Authorization Servers (AS),
   creating a fundamental challenge: how can an agent from Organization
   A securely prove its identity and authorization to resources in
   Organization B?

   While OAuth 2.0 and related specifications provide robust
   authorization frameworks for human users and pre-registered clients,
   the emergence of autonomous agent systems operating across
   organizational boundaries presents new challenges that existing
   mechanisms do not fully address.

   This challenge is distinct from traditional cross-domain identity
   federation for human users.  Humans rarely delegate authority through
   multiple organizational boundaries.  Agents routinely do so--an
   orchestrator agent in Domain X may invoke a tool agent in Domain Y,
   which accesses an MCP server in Domain Z.  Existing authorization
   mechanisms such as OAuth 2.0 Dynamic Client Registration [RFC7591]
   and Token Exchange [RFC8693] assume single-domain operation or pre-
   established relationships, and do not address the dynamic, multi-hop
   delegation patterns that characterize modern agentic systems.

   This document analyzes the cross-domain agent authorization problem
   and evaluates solution approaches.  The proposed solution extends
   OAuth 2.0 Client-ID Metadata
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document] with W3C Verifiable
   Credentials [W3C.VCDM2.0] to enable dynamic identity establishment
   without pre-registration across domains, cryptographically verifiable
   authorization claims that travel with the agent, multi-hop delegation
   with monotonic scope narrowing and accountability chains, and
   selective disclosure of sensitive authorization attributes.

   The document is structured as follows: Section 3 defines key
   terminology.  Section 4 presents use cases demonstrating cross-domain
   scenarios.  Section 8.1.1 identifies threats specific to cross-domain
   authorization sharing.  Section 5 establishes requirements and
   evaluates solution approaches.  Section 8.1 covers security
   considerations.

4.1.  Cross-Domain Tool Invocation

   A coding assistant agent operated by Developer Tools Inc. needs to
   invoke a code review tool provided by Code Analysis Corp.  The tool
   is exposed as an MCP Server protected by Code Analysis Corp's
   Authorization Server.

   Cross-Domain Challenge  Developer Tools Inc.'s agent must present
      credentials that Code Analysis Corp's AS can verify, despite
      having no pre-existing trust relationship.  The AS must determine
      what operations the agent may perform based on claims issued by a
      foreign domain.

   Requirements  Verifiable agent and MCP server identity across domain
      boundaries, authorization claims that are interpretable by the
      receiving domain.

4.2.  Enterprise Partnership Integration

   Company A partners with Company B to provide integrated customer
   support services.  Company A deploys a support agent that needs to
   access Company B's customer ticketing system and knowledge base to
   resolve customer issues.

   Cross-Domain Challenge  Company A's agent authenticates using Company
      A's IdP and holds a Verifiable Credential issued by Company A.
      Company B's Authorization Server has no trust relationship with
      Company A's IdP--it cannot verify Company A's tokens.  Company B
      needs a mechanism to verify the agent's identity and authorization
      claims without requiring bilateral federation setup for every
      partner.

   Requirements  Dynamic identity verification across domains,
      verifiable compliance attestations, and scope restrictions that
      Company B's AS can enforce based on Company A's authorization
      grants.

4.3.  Multi-Vendor Workflow Orchestration

   A security operations workflow involves agents from multiple vendors:
   an orchestrator agent from Security Vendor X coordinates a threat
   intelligence agent from Vendor Y and a remediation agent from Vendor
   Z.  The orchestrator must delegate appropriate permissions to each
   specialized agent.

   Cross-Domain Challenge  The orchestrator in Domain X must delegate

      authority to agents in Domains Y and Z.  Each receiving domain
      must verify the delegation chain, ensure the delegated scope does
      not exceed what the originating principal authorized, and maintain
      an auditable record of the delegation chain.  Receiving domains
      must ensure that the authorization decisions do not rely on
      revoked, suspended, or superseded delegations by performing
      runtime delegation chain verification according to the local
      policy.

   Requirements  Multi-hop delegation with scope narrowing, cross-domain
      accountability chains, privacy-preserving identity claims, and
      domain-specific policy enforcement at each trust boundary
      crossing.

4.4.  Supply Chain Data Exchange

   A manufacturer's inventory management agent needs to query suppliers'
   availability systems.  Multiple suppliers operate their own
   authorization infrastructure.  The agent must access each supplier's
   MCP servers with appropriate credentials.

   Cross-Domain Challenge  Each supplier's AS must verify the
      manufacturer's agent without requiring manual pre-registration.
      Dynamic Client Registration [RFC7591] would require the agent to
      register separately with each supplier's AS, creating operational
      overhead and not providing cryptographic verification of the
      agent's authorization claims from its home domain.  The agent may
      need different permission levels at different suppliers based on
      partnership agreements.  Suppliers must be able to audit which
      manufacturer agents accessed their data.

   Requirements  Dynamic agent provisioning across multiple foreign
      domains, verifiable identity without pre-registration, and domain-
      specific scope mappings.

4.5.  Regulatory Compliance Across Jurisdictions

   A financial services agent operating in the EU needs to access data
   from a partner institution in the US.  Both jurisdictions have
   different regulatory requirements.

   Cross-Domain Challenge  The receiving domain's AS must verify that
      the requesting agent's compliance attestations meet local policy
      requirements.  The VC issued by the originating domain asserts
      compliance with GDPR; the receiving domain must determine whether
      this satisfies its own data handling requirements without assuming
      equivalence of compliance frameworks.

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


   Requirements  Verifiable compliance attestations that receiving
      domains can evaluate against local policies, and data sensitivity
      clearance, verification across regulatory boundaries.

5.  Requirements Summary

   A system for cross-domain sharing of authorization information of
   agents needs to meet the following set of requirements:

   *  *Dynamic Identity for Agents and MCP Servers:* The Agents and MCP
      Servers can onboard dynamically and get an assigned identity in
      the IdP.

   *  *Interoperability Across Domains:* The system must enable seamless
      interaction between Agents across different domains.

   *  *Flexible Definition of Claims:* Claims should be adaptable as
      they may vary from organization to organization.  They may include
      information related to authorization, compliance requirements,
      chains of delegation, and other domain-specific concerns.

   *  *Dynamic Management of Authorization Information:* The system must
      allow creation, removal, updating, and deletion of authorization
      information for agents, as agents can be highly dynamic.

   *  *Security and Privacy:* Ensuring secure and private sharing of
      authorization information across domains.

   *  *Compliance and Auditability:* Support for compliance with
      regulatory standards and auditability of authorization exchanges.

6.  Solution Approaches

6.1.  Solution Approach 1: Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)

   *Description:* Dynamic Client Registration as outlined in [RFC7591]
   allows clients to register with an AS dynamically, facilitating the
   management of client credentials and metadata.

6.2.  Solution Approach 2: SCIM extensions

   [I-D.abbey-scim-agent-extension] proposes extending the SCIM (System
   for Cross-Domain Identity Management) protocol to standardize the
   provisioning, management, and governance of AI agents and other
   digital workers.

   [I-D.wahl-scim-agent-schema] is a companion document to the draft-
   abbey-scim-agent-extension.  Its purpose is to define the specific
   SCIM schema and attributes required to represent AI agents (digital
   workers) and agentic applications within the SCIM framework.

   clients to identify themselves using a URL, which points to a JSON
   file containing their OAuth metadata.  Instead of requiring pre-
   registration, an authorization server can fetch this JSON document at
   the client's provided URL to provision the identity.

   **Flexible Definition of Claims:* The OAuth claims in the draft
   follow the claims exposed and defined by IANA OAuth Parameters.
   Hence, the metadata fields are limited to a fixed set of claims.
   This makes it difficult to convey richer features about the client,
   including provenance details, compliance attestations, or contextual
   trust scores without introducing vendor-specific extensions, thereby
   reducing portability and interoperability.

   ***Security and Privacy, Compliance and Auditability:* All metadata
   is published to a publicly accessible endpoint.  There is no native
   ability to keep certain attributes private, apply selective
   disclosure, or restrict visibility based on trust relationships.
   Sensitive operational data or compliance-related data must be handled
   outside the metadata framework, leading to fragmented trust models.
   There is no mechanism for revocation and expiration.

   *Description:* The proposed solution is based on Solution 3, but
   enhances the supported claims with a new claim, "vc+jwt", based on
   the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 from W3C.

   vc+jwt  A standard method used in decentralized identity to package
      and secure a digital credential.  The Verifiable Credential
      (VC)—the actual data proving a fact (e.g., identity or degree)—is
      encapsulated within a JSON Web Token (JWT), which provides a
      cryptographic signature from the issuer.  This signature allows
      any third party (the Verifier) to instantly confirm the
      credential's authenticity and integrity.  Modern formats like SD-
      JWT VC further enhance this by enabling the holder to share only
      specific parts of the credential (Selective Disclosure) to protect
      privacy.

   *Detailed explanations:*

   The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 addresses the
   shortcomings of the previous Solution 3, by introducing a
   cryptographically verifiable and standards-based way to assert
   identities, capabilities, and compliance attestations.  It supports
   selective disclosure to protect sensitive information, enables time-
   bound and revocable authorizations, and ensures provenance tracking
   for audit and regulatory compliance.  They are part of a broader
   decentralized identity (DID) specification.

   Using the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 for Agents, MCP
   Clients, and MCP Servers provides a standardized, cryptographically
   secure way to establish trust, delegate authority, and ensure
   interoperability across different systems.

   It enables Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers to prove, among other
   things, their identities, identity issuers and provenance, supported
   skills and permitted actions through verifiable proofs, including
   support for fine-grained and time-bound access control, while
   maintaining transparency enabling audit trails for compliance.

   Additionally, it enhances privacy through selective disclosure and
   privacy-preserving proofs (e.g., allowing Agents to prove skills and
   authorized actions without exposing unnecessary details).

   The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 is a W3C standard that fits
   the needs expressed above:

   *(1) Enhanced Interoperability:* VCDM 2.0 provides a standardized,
   extensible way to express identities, capabilities, and compliance
   data across different systems.  Its use of DIDs and schema-governed
   claims ensures that Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers can verify
   and exchange trust information, enabling consistent interoperability
   across domains and platforms.

   *(2) Flexible Definition of Claims:* VCDM 2.0 allows arbitrary,
   schema-governed claims that can represent complex concepts such as
   provenance, software supply-chain attestations (e.g., SLSA), security
   posture, audit certifications (SOC2, ISO-27001), or dynamic trust
   signals.  These claims can be extended without breaking
   interoperability, thanks to widely adopted JSON-LD and schema
   registries.

   *(3) Security and Privacy:* Credentials are signed using verifiable
   cryptographic proofs (e.g., JSON Web Signatures, Data Integrity
   proofs).  This ensures that Agents, MCP clients, and MCP servers can
   verify the authenticity of claims without relying solely on HTTPS
   endpoints or centralized registries.  Through techniques like BBS+
   signatures, holders can disclose only the subset of claims required
   for a given authorization flow.  This is essential for scenarios
   where Agents must prove capabilities (e.g., "I'm allowed to execute
   this skill") without revealing unnecessary or sensitive identity
   attributes.

   *(4) Compliance and Auditability:* VCDM 2.0 enables cryptographically
   verifiable audit trails by binding each credential to an issuer,
   timestamp, and revocation status.  Compliance attestations can be
   embedded directly in credentials, and real-time revocation checks
   ensure they remain valid.  This provides trustworthy provenance,
   regulatory-grade accountability, and reliable lifecycle tracking
   across distributed systems.

6.4.1.  Delegation Semantics for Cross-Domain Multi-Agent Workflows

   Multi-agent systems frequently involve chains of delegation where
   Agent A invokes Agent B, which may invoke Agent C—potentially
   spanning multiple administrative domains.  This section defines
   authorization semantics for such delegation chains, addressing the
   novel challenges of cross-domain delegation.







Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 13]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


   Humans rarely delegate authority through multiple levels across
   organizational boundaries.  Agents routinely do so.  Existing
   delegation mechanisms ([RFC8693] Token Exchange 'act' claims) assume
   single-domain operation and do not address cross-domain VC-based
   delegation with verifiable accountability chains.

6.4.1.1.  Delegation Models

   This specification supports two delegation models:

   Direct Invocation  Agent A directly invokes MCP Server M using A's
      own credentials.  No delegation occurs; authorization is based
      solely on A's VC.

   Delegated Invocation (Cross-Domain)  Agent A in Domain X invokes
      Agent B in Domain Y to perform a task.  B acts on A's behalf (and
      transitively, on behalf of A's originating principal) when
      accessing resources.  The authorization decision considers both
      A's delegation grant and B's own credentials, applying Domain Y's
      policies.

   Domain X                          |  Domain Y
                                     |
   +-----------+   +---------+       |  +---------+   +--------------+
   | Principal |   | Agent A |       |  | Agent B |   | MCP Server M |
   |     P     |   |         |       |  |         |   |              |
   +-----------+   +---------+       |  +---------+   +--------------+
         |              |            |       |               |

6.4.1.2.  Scope Derivation Rules

   When Agent A delegates to Agent B (potentially across domains), B's
   effective scope MUST be computed as the intersection of:

   1.  A's delegatable scope: The subset of A's permissions that A is
       authorized to delegate

   2.  B's intrinsic scope: The permissions B holds in its own VC

   3.  Explicit delegation grant: What A actually delegated to B for
       this invocation

   4.  Receiving domain policy: The maximum scope the receiving domain
       permits for this cross-domain delegation

   Effective_Scope(B) = A.delegatable_scope
                        INTERSECT B.intrinsic_scope
                        INTERSECT Delegation.granted_scope
                        INTERSECT Receiving_Domain_Policy

                     Figure 3: Scope Derivation Formula

   This ensures:

   *  B cannot exceed A's authority (no privilege amplification)

   *  B cannot exceed its own authority (intrinsic limits apply)

   *  A can further restrict B for specific tasks (explicit grant)

   *  The receiving domain retains sovereignty over its resources (local
      policy)

   Implementations MUST enforce monotonic scope narrowing: at each
   delegation step, effective scope can only decrease or remain the
   same, never increase.

   This intersection semantics aligns with capability-based security
   principles (see: Mark Miller's Principle of Least Authority, Google
   Macaroons, Biscuit authorization tokens) and extends [RFC8693] Token
   Exchange delegation semantics to cross-domain VC-based scenarios.

6.4.1.3.  Accountability Chain Construction

   Each delegation step MUST produce a verifiable record enabling cross-
   domain forensic reconstruction.To support revocation and scope-change
   handling, delegation records SHOULD enable downstream verifiers to
   identify and validate upstream delegation elements so that
   authorization decisions do not depend on revoked or superseded
   delegation claims.  The delegation record MUST include:

    +==================+=================+===========================+
    | Field            | Description     | Cross-Domain Relevance    |

   The complete accountability chain enables:

   1.  Cross-domain attribution: Determining which principal originated
       a request that traversed multiple domains

   2.  Forensic reconstruction: Rebuilding the sequence of delegations
       across domain boundaries

   3.  Coordinated revocation: Identifying downstream delegations in
       other domains that must be invalidated

6.4.1.4.  Delegation Depth Limits

   Implementations SHOULD enforce maximum delegation depth.  Cross-
   domain delegations SHOULD count toward depth limits regardless of
   whether they're same-domain or cross-domain.

   Receiving domains MAY impose stricter depth limits than the
   originating domain.  When a delegation would exceed the receiving
   domain's depth limit, the AS MUST reject the request with an error
   indicating the depth violation.

6.4.1.5.  Delegation Claims in VCs

   To express delegation authority in VCs, the following claims are
   defined for credentialSubject:

   {
     "credentialSubject": {
       "id": "https://example.com/agents/agent-a",
       "delegation": {
         "permitted": true,

      delegation is allowed at all.

   delegation.crossDomainDelegation.allowedDomains  Domains to which
      delegation is permitted (wildcards allowed).

   delegation.scopeRestrictions.crossDomainNonDelegatable  Scopes that

6.4.2.  Agent Authorization Verifiable Credential Profile

   This section defines a Verifiable Credential profile that enables
   interoperable cross-domain agent authorization.  The profile
   specifies claims that Authorization Servers in different domains can
   reliably interpret.

   W3C VCDM 2.0 is intentionally flexible.  For cross-domain
   interoperability, domains must agree on claim semantics.  This
   profile provides that common language.

6.4.2.1.  Profile Objectives

   The Agent Authorization VC Profile (AAVC) enables:

   *  Cross-domain interoperability: ASs in different domains can parse
      and evaluate the same VC

   *  Semantic clarity: Claim meanings are defined, reducing policy skew
      risk

   *  Extensibility: Organizations can add custom claims without
      breaking base interoperability

   *  Selective disclosure compatibility: Claims are structured to
      support SD-JWT VC presentation

6.4.2.2.  Required Claims for Cross-Domain Interoperability

   The credentialSubject MUST include these claims for a VC to be
   recognized across domains:

   id (required)  Globally unique identifier for the agent.  SHOULD be a
      dereferenceable URI pointing to client-id metadata.

   agentType (required)  Classification of the agent.  Receiving domains
      use this to apply type-specific policies.  Implementations MUST
      support:

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


      *  tool-agent: Provides specific tool/skill capabilities

      *  orchestrator-agent: Coordinates other agents

      *  workflow-agent: Executes multi-step workflows

      *  system-agent: Long-running infrastructure agent

      *  ephemeral-agent: Short-lived, single-task

   authorizedScopes (required)  Authorization scopes this agent may
      request.  Receiving domains map these to local authorization
      policies.

   issuerDomain (required)  Administrative domain of the credential
      issuer.  Receiving ASs use this to look up trust relationships and
      policy mappings.

6.4.2.3.  Recommended Claims for Production Deployments

   dataSensitivityClearance (recommended)  Maximum data sensitivity
      level this agent may access.  Standard values:

      *  public - Publicly available information

      *  internal - Organization-internal, non-sensitive

      *  confidential - Business-sensitive information

      *  restricted - Highly sensitive, need-to-know basis

      *  regulated - Subject to regulatory controls (PII, PHI, PCI)

   complianceAttestations (recommended)  Compliance certifications
      relevant to cross-domain trust decisions.  Should include
      standard, scope, validUntil, and optionally certificationBody.

   operationalConstraints (recommended)  Runtime constraints that
      receiving domains MAY enforce, including maxConcurrentSessions,
      maxRequestsPerMinute, allowedTimeWindows, and geofence
      restrictions.

   delegation (recommended)  Delegation permissions as defined in
      Section 6.4.1.5.

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


6.4.2.4.  Extension Mechanism

   Organizations MAY extend the profile with additional claims by:

   1.  Defining a JSON-LD context document for the extension

   2.  Including the extension context URI in the VC's @context array

   3.  Adding extension claims under a namespace prefix

   Implementations receiving VCs with unrecognized claims SHOULD:

   *  Ignore unknown claims (do not reject the VC)

   *  Log unrecognized claims for operational visibility

   *  NOT make authorization decisions based on claims they cannot
      interpret

6.4.2.5.  Interoperability Requirements

   For cross-domain interoperability, implementations:

   MUST:

   *  Support required claims (id, agentType, authorizedScopes,
      issuerDomain)

   *  Recognize the AgentAuthorizationCredential type

   *  Verify the credential proof before processing claims

   *  Reject VCs missing required claims

   SHOULD:

   *  Support recommended claims

   *  Implement selective disclosure for cross-domain presentations

   *  Maintain logs of cross-domain VC presentations

   MAY:

   *  Define and process organization-specific extensions

   *  Implement additional validation beyond profile requirements

7.  Example

   This section provides illustrative examples of how Client-ID Metadata
   can be extended with Verifiable Credentials for agent identity.
   These examples demonstrate the recommended Approach 4 and show how
   the concepts apply to scenarios similar to the travel booking use
   case described earlier.  These examples are non-normative and
   intended to demonstrate the concepts discussed in this document.

7.1.  Client-ID Metadata Example

   The following example shows OAuth client metadata that includes a
   Verifiable Credential in the "vc+jwt" field:

   {
     "client_id": "https://agents.example.com/agent-001/metadata.json",
     "client_name": "Customer Service Agent 001",
     "jwks_uri": "https://agents.example.com/agent-001/jwks.json",
     "token_endpoint_auth_method": "private_key_jwt",
     "grant_types": ["client_credentials"],
     "scope": "read:orders write:tickets",
     "vc+jwt": "eyJhbGciOiJFZERTQSIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJAY29udGV4dCI6W..."
   }

   The "vc+jwt" field contains a JWT-encoded Verifiable Credential.  The
   actual JWT would be significantly longer and contain the complete
   credential structure shown in the next subsection.

7.2.  Verifiable Credential Example

   The following example shows the decoded structure of a Verifiable
   Credential for an agent (before JWT encoding):

   {
     "@context": [
       "https://www.w3.org/2018/credentials/v1",
       "https://example.org/agent-credentials/v1"
     ],
     "type": ["VerifiableCredential", "AgentIdentityCredential"],
     "issuer": "did:web:issuer.example.com",
     "issuanceDate": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "expirationDate": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z",
     "credentialSubject": {
       "id": "https://agents.example.com/agent-001/metadata.json",
       "agentName": "Customer Service Agent 001",
       "agentVersion": "2.1.0",
       "agentType": "customer-service",
       "owner": "did:web:example.com",

       "authorizedCapabilities": [
         "order-lookup",
         "ticket-creation",
         "customer-notification"
       ],
       "delegatedCredentials":[
         {
           "id": "https://agents.partner.com/agent-111/metadata.json",
           "agentName":"Sec Agent 111",
           "delegatedBy":"https://agents.example.com/agent-001/metadata.json",
           "delegationChain": [
                   "urn:uuid:*****",
                   "urn:uuid:***"
           ],
           "scope": "read:sec-remediate:isolations",
           "authorizedCapabilities": [
                   "enrichment",
                   "isolation-request"
           ],
       "constraints": {
         "dpopNonceRequired": true
           }
         }
       ],
       "complianceFrameworks": ["SOC2-TypeII", "ISO-27001"],
       "delegationLevel": 1,
       "maxDelegationDepth": 2
     },
     "credentialStatus": {
       "id": "https://issuer.example.com/status/2024/12345",
       "type": "StatusList2021Entry",
       "statusPurpose": "revocation",
       "statusListIndex": "12345",
       "statusListCredential": "https://issuer.example.com/status/2024"
     }
   }

   Note: The actual credential would include a "proof" section with
   cryptographic signatures.  The proof section is omitted here for
   clarity, as it would add significant length to the example.  The
   proof structure varies depending on the signature suite used (e.g.,
   Ed25519Signature2020, JsonWebSignature2020).

8.  Security Considerations







Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 22]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


8.1.  Security Considerations

   This section addresses security considerations specific to cross-
   domain authorization information sharing.  Implementations MUST also
   follow security guidance in [RFC6819], [W3C.VCDM2.0], and
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document].

8.1.1.  Threat Model for Cross-Domain Authorization Sharing

   This section defines threats specific to sharing authorization
   information across administrative domain boundaries.  General OAuth
   and VC security threats are addressed in [RFC6819] and [W3C.VCDM2.0];
   this section focuses on threats that emerge or are amplified when
   credentials cross domain boundaries.

8.1.1.1.  Protected Assets in Cross-Domain Scenarios

   Beyond standard authorization assets, cross-domain sharing introduces
   additional assets requiring protection:

   Cross-Domain Trust Relationships  The established trust between
      domains that enables agents to operate across organizational
      boundaries.  Compromise affects all agents relying on that trust
      relationship.

   Shared Authorization Semantics  The agreed-upon meaning of claims,
      scopes, and compliance attestations between domains.  Semantic
      drift or manipulation can cause authorization decisions that
      violate one or both domains' policies.

   Delegation Chains Spanning Domains  When agent A in Domain X
      delegates to agent B in Domain Y, the chain itself becomes an
      asset requiring integrity protection across trust boundaries.

8.1.1.2.  Cross-Domain Specific Threat Actors

   Rogue Domain  An entire domain that participates in the trust
      federation but issues fraudulent VCs or makes incorrect
      authorization decisions—either through compromise or malicious
      operation.  Unlike a single rogue IdP, a rogue domain may control
      IdP, AS, and metadata endpoints coherently.

   Cross-Domain Insider  An administrator with legitimate access in
      Domain A who abuses cross-domain trust relationships to gain
      unauthorized access to Domain B's resources.

8.1.1.3.  Cross-Domain Attack Categories




Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 23]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


8.1.1.3.1.  Trust Anchor Attacks

   Metadata Endpoint Compromise  An attacker gains control of the URL
      hosting an agent's client-id metadata document and substitutes
      malicious metadata or VCs.  Because the metadata URL is the trust
      anchor for cross-domain identity, compromise enables complete
      identity takeover across all trusting domains.

      Cross-domain amplification: In single-domain scenarios, the AS
      typically has out-of-band trust with clients.  In cross-domain
      scenarios, the metadata endpoint IS the sole trust anchor—there's
      no fallback.

   Metadata Poisoning  Injection of false claims into legitimate
      metadata documents through supply chain attacks, DNS hijacking, or
      exploitation of hosting infrastructure.

      Cross-domain amplification: Poisoned metadata propagates trust
      violations to all domains that fetch and cache the metadata.

8.1.1.3.2.  Semantic Attacks

   Policy Skew Exploitation  An agent authorized under Domain A's
      policies operates in Domain B where different security policies
      apply.  The agent performs actions that are within Domain A's
      authorized scope but violate Domain B's policies.

   Claim Semantic Drift  Domains interpret the same claim differently,
      leading to authorization decisions that neither domain intended.

   Compliance Attestation Mismatch  Compliance attestations (SOC2, ISO-
      27001, GDPR) in VCs are accepted at face value without verifying
      that the issuing domain's certification scope covers the receiving
      domain's requirements.

8.1.1.3.3.  Delegation Attacks Across Domains

   Cross-Domain Privilege Amplification  In multi-hop delegation (A to B
      to C) where agents belong to different domains, downstream agents
      in permissive domains accumulate effective permissions that exceed
      what the originating principal intended.

   Accountability Chain Breakage  Delegation chains that cross domain
      boundaries lose forensic continuity.  When incidents occur,
      attribution cannot be reconstructed because each domain only has
      partial visibility.

   Confused Deputy Across Trust Boundaries  An attacker in Domain A



Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 24]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


      tricks a trusted agent in Domain B into performing actions on
      their behalf that the attacker couldn't perform
      directly—exploiting the cross-domain trust relationship.  See
      [Hardy1988].

8.1.1.3.4.  Cross-Domain Lateral Movement

   Using legitimate cross-domain authorization to pivot from a
   compromised position in Domain A to resources in Domain B that would
   not otherwise be accessible.  An attacker compromises a low-privilege
   agent in Domain A.  That agent has cross-domain authorization to
   Domain B.  The attacker uses the agent's credentials to establish a
   foothold in Domain B, then escalates within Domain B.

8.1.1.3.5.  Correlation and Privacy Attacks

   Linking agent activities across domains using stable identifiers in
   VCs to build profiles of organizational operations, potentially
   revealing sensitive business processes or security postures.

   Cross-domain amplification: In single-domain scenarios, the domain
   controls what's logged.  In cross-domain scenarios, each domain
   receiving the VC can correlate independently, and the agent's home
   domain cannot prevent this.

8.1.1.4.  Trust Establishment Between Domains

8.1.1.4.1.  Domain Trust Lists

   Before accepting VCs from another domain, an Authorization Server
   MUST verify that the issuing domain is in an explicitly configured
   trust list.  Implementations MUST NOT implicitly trust domains based
   solely on successful cryptographic verification of the VC.

   Trust list entries SHOULD include:

   *  Domain identifier (issuerDomain claim value)

   *  Accepted VC types from that domain

   *  Scope of trust (which local resources may be accessed)

   *  Expiration or review date for the trust relationship








Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 25]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


8.1.1.4.2.  Cross-Domain Policy Mapping

   Implementations MUST NOT assume semantic equivalence of claims across
   domains.  Before accepting a VC from another domain, the AS SHOULD
   verify:

   1.  Explicit mapping exists between the foreign domain's claim
       semantics and local policy requirements

   2.  Compliance attestations in the VC meet local regulatory
       requirements (not just the issuing domain's)

   3.  Scope values have been mapped to local authorization semantics

8.1.1.4.3.  Trust Relationship Lifecycle

   Cross-domain trust relationships MUST have defined lifecycles:

   *  Periodic review and re-validation

   *  Documented procedures for trust relationship termination

   *  Immediate revocation capability when a trusted domain is
      compromised

   *  Notification mechanisms between domains for security events

8.1.1.5.  Metadata Endpoint Security for Cross-Domain Trust

   Because the client-id metadata endpoint is the sole trust anchor for
   cross-domain agent identity, it requires enhanced protection beyond
   typical endpoint security.

8.1.1.5.1.  Endpoint Integrity Beyond Transport

   Metadata documents SHOULD be signed independently of the transport
   layer, allowing verification even if TLS is compromised or if the
   document is cached by intermediaries.

8.1.1.5.2.  Change Detection for Cached Metadata

   Authorization Servers SHOULD:

   *  Cache fetched metadata documents with appropriate TTLs

   *  Detect and alert on unexpected changes to critical fields
      (jwks_uri, vc+jwt, token_endpoint_auth_method)




Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 26]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


   *  Implement anomaly detection for metadata that changes more
      frequently than expected

8.1.1.5.3.  Cross-Domain Availability Dependencies

   When metadata endpoints are unavailable, cross-domain authorization
   fails.  Implementations SHOULD:

   *  Cache validated metadata with TTLs appropriate to the sensitivity
      of protected resources

   *  Implement circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures

   *  Define graceful degradation policies

8.1.1.6.  Delegation Security Across Domain Boundaries

8.1.1.6.1.  Domain Boundary Checkpoints

   When a delegation chain crosses a domain boundary, the receiving
   domain's AS MUST:

   *  Fully verify the upstream delegation chain before accepting

   *  Apply local policy to the delegation

   *  Log the domain boundary crossing for audit purposes

   Receiving domains SHOULD consider the status of delegated credentials
   and, where status information is available, avoid making
   authorization decisions that rely on revoked,suspended, or suspended
   delegation chain elements, according to local policy.

   Deployments concerned with stale delgations MAY apply bounded caching
   and periodic revalidation of delegation status appropriate to the
   sensitivity of protected resources.

8.1.1.6.2.  Monotonic Scope Narrowing Across Domains

   Implementations MUST enforce that effective scope can only decrease
   (or remain the same) at each delegation step, including when crossing
   domain boundaries.  The receiving domain MUST apply its local policy
   as an additional constraint on effective scope.

8.1.1.6.3.  Accountability Chain Preservation

   Delegation chains spanning domains MUST maintain cryptographically
   verifiable accountability.  Each domain SHOULD:



Diaconu, et al.           Expires 6 August 2026                [Page 27]

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           February 2026


   *  Preserve the incoming delegation chain in its audit logs

   *  Add its own delegation record when extending the chain

   *  Provide APIs for authorized forensic queries from upstream domains

8.1.1.7.  Privacy Considerations for Cross-Domain Sharing

8.1.1.7.1.  Selective Disclosure for Cross-Domain Presentations

   Agents presenting VCs across domain boundaries SHOULD use selective
   disclosure mechanisms (SD-JWT VC, BBS+ signatures) to reveal only
   claims necessary for the specific cross-domain authorization request.

8.1.1.7.2.  Correlation Risk Assessment

   Organizations SHOULD assess cross-domain correlation risks before
   establishing trust relationships, including whether agent identifiers
   enable activity tracking by foreign domains.

9.  IANA Considerations

   This document introduces a new OAuth client metadata parameter
   "vc+jwt" as described in the Solution Analysis section (Approach 4).
   If this approach is standardized, the following registration would be
   required:

   *  *Registry:* IANA [`OAuth Dynamic Client Registration
      Metadata`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/oauth-parameters/
      oauth-parameters.xhtml#client-metadata) registry

   *  *Client Metadata Name:* vc+jwt

   *  *Client Metadata Description:* JWT-encoded Verifiable Credential

   *  *Change Controller:* TBD

   *  *Reference:* https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model-2.0

   This informational document does not make a formal request for IANA
   registration at this time.  Registration would be appropriate if this
   approach is adopted and progresses to a standards track
   specification.
