           Cross-Domain AuthZ Information sharing for Agents
                     draft-vc-client-id-metadata-00

Abstract

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems consist of Agents and MCP Servers
   operating across multiple administrative domains, each with its own
   Identity Providers (IdPs) and Authorization Servers (AS).

   This document discusses the challenges and solution approaches for
   sharing authorization information securely and flexibly across
   domains, including the use of dynamic identity, interoperable claims,
   and verifiable credentials.

             Figure 1: Cross-Domain Multi-Agent Architecture

   Distributed Multi-Agent Systems contain Agents and MCP Servers that
   are distributed across multiple administrative domains.  These
   systems involve different Identity Providers (IdPs) / Authorization
   Servers (AS) posing challenges in authorization information sharing
   across these entities.

4.  Use Cases

4.1.  Predictive Threat Detection

   *Description:* Enhance security by predicting threats based on
   behavior analysis.

   *Use Case:* An organization uses behavior analysis systems to analyze
   agent behavior patterns.  Client-ID Metadata provides a framework for
   registering agents, while W3C VCs ensure identity verification and
   provide additional context for the intended tasks of a specific agent
   (Ex: may access production logs but not PII).

   The system predicts potential security breaches by assessing
   deviations in agent behavior and recommends preventive actions,
   aligning with Zero Trust strategies.

4.2.  Automated Compliance Monitoring

   *Description:* Automate compliance checks across distributed systems.

   *Use Case:* A financial institution monitors compliance with
   regulatory requirements.  Agents registered through Client-ID
   Metadata are verified for compliance based on their provided proofs
   as W3C VCs (Ex: this agent uses this model approved by policy X).

   The system automatically evaluates compliance status based on
   provided VCs and generates alerts for any discrepancies, ensuring
   adherence to Zero Trust policies.

5.  Requirements

   A system for cross-domain sharing of authorization information of
   agents needs to meet the following set of requirements:

   *  *Dynamic Identity for Agents and MCP Servers:* The Agents and MCP
      Servers can onboard dynamically and get an assigned identity in
      the IdP.

   *  *Interoperability Across Domains:* The system must enable seamless
      interaction between Agents across different domains.

   *  *Flexible Definition of Claims:* Claims should be adaptable as
      they may vary from organization to organization.

   *  *Dynamic Management of Authorization Information:* The system must
      allow creation, removal, updating, and deletion of authorization
      information for agents, as agents can be highly dynamic.

Internet-Draft          AuthZ Sharing for Agents           December 2025


   *  *Security and Privacy:* Ensuring secure and private sharing of
      authorization information across domains.

   *  *Compliance and Auditability:* Support for compliance with
      regulatory standards and auditability of authorization exchanges.

5.1.  Solution Approach 1: Dynamic Client Registration (RFC 7591)

   *Description:* Dynamic Client Registration as outlined in [RFC7591]
   allows clients to register with an AS dynamically, facilitating the
   management of client credentials and metadata.

5.2.  Solution Approach 2: SCIM extensions

   [I-D.abbey-scim-agent-extension] proposes extending the SCIM (System
   for Cross-Domain Identity Management) protocol to standardize the
   provisioning, management, and governance of AI agents and other
   digital workers.

   [I-D.wahl-scim-agent-schema] is a companion document to the draft-
   abbey-scim-agent-extension.  Its purpose is to define the specific
   SCIM schema and attributes required to represent AI agents (digital
   workers) and agentic applications within the SCIM framework.

   *Description:* Provision Agents / MCP Servers through a SCIM
   extension.

   *Description:* Client ID Metadata
   [I-D.ietf-oauth-client-id-metadata-document] is a method for OAuth
   clients to identify themselves using a URL, which points to a JSON
   file containing their OAuth metadata.  Instead of requiring pre-
   registration, an authorization server can fetch this JSON document at
   the client's provided URL to provision the identity.

   **Flexible Definition of Claims:* The OAuth claims in the draft
   follow the claims exposed and defined by IANA OAuth Parameters.
   Hence, the metadata fields are limited to a fixed set of claims.
   This makes it difficult to convey richer features about the client,
   including provenance details, compliance attestations, or contextual
   trust scores without introducing vendor-specific extensions, thereby
   reducing portability and interoperability.

   ***Security and Privacy, Compliance and Auditability:* All metadata
   is published to a publicly accessible endpoint.  There is no native
   ability to keep certain attributes private, apply selective
   disclosure, or restrict visibility based on trust relationships.
   Sensitive operational data or compliance-related data must be handled

          Figure 2: Client-ID Metadata with VC Verification Flow

   *Description:* The proposed solution is based on Solution 3, but
   enhances the supported claims with a new claim, "vc+jwt", based on
   the Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 from W3C.

   vc+jwt  A standard method used in decentralized identity to package
      and secure a digital credential.  The Verifiable Credential
      (VC)—the actual data proving a fact (e.g., identity or degree)—is
      encapsulated within a JSON Web Token (JWT), which provides a
      cryptographic signature from the issuer.  This signature allows
      any third party (the Verifier) to instantly confirm the
      credential's authenticity and integrity.  Modern formats like SD-
      JWT VC further enhance this by enabling the holder to share only
      specific parts of the credential (Selective Disclosure) to protect
      privacy.

   *Detailed explanations:*

   The W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 addresses the
   shortcomings of the previous Solution 3, by introducing a
   cryptographically verifiable and standards-based way to assert
   identities, capabilities, and compliance attestations.  It supports
   selective disclosure to protect sensitive information, enables time-
   bound and revocable authorizations, and ensures provenance tracking
   for audit and regulatory compliance.  They are part of a broader
   decentralized identity (DID) specification.

   Using the W3C Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 for Agents, MCP
   Clients, and MCP Servers provides a standardized, cryptographically
   secure way to establish trust, delegate authority, and ensure
   interoperability across different systems.

   It enables Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers to prove, among other
   things, their identities, identity issuers and provenance, supported
   skills and permitted actions through verifiable proofs, including
   support for fine-grained and time-bound access control, while
   maintaining transparency enabling audit trails for compliance.

   Additionally, it enhances privacy through selective disclosure and
   privacy-preserving proofs (e.g., allowing Agents to prove skills and
   authorized actions without exposing unnecessary details).

   The Verifiable Credentials Data Model 2.0 is a W3C standard that fits
   the needs expressed above:

   *(1) Enhanced Interoperability:* VCDM 2.0 provides a standardized,
   extensible way to express identities, capabilities, and compliance
   data across different systems.  Its use of DIDs and schema-governed
   claims ensures that Agents, MCP Clients, and MCP Servers can verify
   and exchange trust information, enabling consistent interoperability
   across domains and platforms.

   *(2) Flexible Definition of Claims:* VCDM 2.0 allows arbitrary,
   schema-governed claims that can represent complex concepts such as
   provenance, software supply-chain attestations (e.g., SLSA), security
   posture, audit certifications (SOC2, ISO-27001), or dynamic trust
   signals.  These claims can be extended without breaking
   interoperability, thanks to widely adopted JSON-LD and schema
   registries.

   *(3) Security and Privacy:* Credentials are signed using verifiable
   cryptographic proofs (e.g., JSON Web Signatures, Data Integrity
   proofs).  This ensures that Agents, MCP clients, and MCP servers can
   verify the authenticity of claims without relying solely on HTTPS
   endpoints or centralized registries.  Through techniques like BBS+
   signatures, holders can disclose only the subset of claims required
   for a given authorization flow.  This is essential for scenarios
   where Agents must prove capabilities (e.g., "I'm allowed to execute
   this skill") without revealing unnecessary or sensitive identity
   attributes.

   *(4) Compliance and Auditability:* VCDM 2.0 enables cryptographically
   verifiable audit trails by binding each credential to an issuer,
   timestamp, and revocation status.  Compliance attestations can be
   embedded directly in credentials, and real-time revocation checks
   ensure they remain valid.  This provides trustworthy provenance,
   regulatory-grade accountability, and reliable lifecycle tracking
   across distributed systems.
